	"6 corresponds to Exhaust. Stream the data down full blast in multiple “more” packages, on the assumption that the client will fully read all data queried. Faster when you are pulling a lot of data and know you want to pull it all down. Note: the client is not allowed to not read all the data unless it closes the connection"
