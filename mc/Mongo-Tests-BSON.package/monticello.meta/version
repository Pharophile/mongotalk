(name 'Mongo-Tests-BSON-MartinDias.2' message 'Creating MongoTimeStamp.As MongoDb documentation [2] states: "BSON has a special timestamp type for internal MongoDB use and is not associated with the regular Datetype. Timestamp values are a 64 bit value where:- the first 32 bits are a time_t value (seconds since the Unix epoch)- the second 32 bits are an incrementing ordinal for operations within a given second."Now, our Mongo bindings [1] convert this MongoDb''s internal type to Pharo''s TimeStamp (i.e. the subclass of DateAndTime) with two problems: - it''s a wrong: the 2 parts of 32 bits are converted as 64 bits of milliseconds- it produces a warning in latest Pharo [3]: TimeStamp has been removed so extension methods cannot be installed.That''s why I''m creating MongoTimeStamp, and changing BSON marshaling from:BSON>>nextTimestamp	^self nextDateAndTime asTimeStampto:BSON>>nextTimestamp	^MongoTimeStamp value: self nextInt64(similar for writing).This solution was idea of Esteban and Norbert, and discussed in the issue tracker of Voyage [3]. Mongo talk team, please tell me if you don''t agree.1: http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~MongoTalkTeam/mongotalk2: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/bson-types/#timestamps3: https://github.com/estebanlm/voyage/issues/11' id '2749e4af-3a35-4dc3-9e8f-88f7518d1aa1' date '15 March 2016' time '12:54:39.771268 am' author 'MartinDias' ancestors ((name 'Mongo-Tests-BSON-TorstenBergmann.1' message 'initial version based on Mongo-BSON-NorbertHartl.40' id '5ab0c65b-0da3-7049-88f2-e9e80f448305' date '4 March 2015' time '10:10:03.3601 am' author 'TorstenBergmann' ancestors () stepChildren ())) stepChildren ())
